## Byte-Sized RSE Series Overview

Byte-sized RSE is a series of standalone mini lessons providing key research software skills in around 1.5 hour. 

### Target audience

* Research software engineers (RSEs) working in academic or research-intensive settings — i.e., people whose role includes developing, maintaining, or supporting research software. 
* Researchers and postgraduate students involved in computational or data-intensive research, who already have some basic software/coding experience and want to level up their software engineering practices.

### Byte-Sized RSE Lessons

At the moment, the following mini lessons constitute the Byte-sized RSE series:
