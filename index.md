## Byte-Sized RSE Series Overview

Byte-sized RSE is a series of standalone mini lessons providing key research software skills in around 1.5 hour. 

### Target audience

* Research software engineers (RSEs) or reseachers who code or build software tools for research working in academic or research-intensive settings — i.e., people whose role includes developing, maintaining, or supporting research software. 
* Researchers and postgraduate students involved in computational or data-intensive research, who already have some basic software/coding experience and want to level up their software engineering practices.

### Byte-Sized RSE Lessons

At the moment, the following mini lessons constitute the Byte-sized RSE series:

* [Code Development & Debugging with IDEs](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-vscode)
* [Code Style, Quality & Linting](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-code-quality)
* [Intermediate Git](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-git-intermediate)
* [Code Review](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-code-review)
* [Unit Testing Code](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-testing)
* [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-ci)

More lessons will be added in the future. If you are interested in contributing - please [contact us](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-overview/blob/main/README.md#contact).

### Learning Objectives/Intended Learning Outcomes

* Gain concrete skills and awareness in research-software engineering practices (e.g., code quality, version control, CI) that improve productivity, maintainability and reproducibility.
* Improve collaboration and code sharing between researchers and software engineers by adopting shared tooling/practices.
* Accelerate the uptake of sound software practices within research groups, reducing technical debt, improving reliability of research software.
* Provide accessible “bite-sized” training modules that fit into busy researcher/technical staff schedules.

::: prereq

Each of the lessons within the Byte-sized RSE series contains a separate set of prerequisites - please refer to that information to learn what prerequsite knowledge is needed in order to effectively follow the lesson.
