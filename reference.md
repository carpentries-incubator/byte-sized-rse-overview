## Glossary

[Research Software Engineer (RSE)]{#rse}
: RSEs combine expertise in programming with an understanding of research methods to make research software reliable, reusable, and reproducible.

[reproducibility]{#reproducibility}
: ability for someone (including the original author) to obtain the same results using the same data, code, and methods.

[version control]{#version-control}
: a system that tracks changes to code and documents over time, enabling collaboration and rollback to previous states. 
Example tools: Git, typically used with platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

[repository]{#repository}
: structured storage space for code, documentation, and configuration files, managed by a version control system. 
It serves as the “home” of a project where collaboration and review happen.

[Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]{#ide}
: software that provides a unified environment for writing, debugging, and testing code. 
Example tools: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, RStudio.

[code quality]{#code-quality}
: degree to which code is readable, maintainable, and free of defects. 
Enhanced through consistent style, refactoring, automated testing, and static analysis (e.g., linters).

[linting]{#linting}
: process of automatically checking source code for stylistic errors, potential bugs, or deviations from coding standards. 
Example tools: flake8, pylint, black (Python).

[unit testing]{#unit-testing}
: writing small, automated tests that verify individual parts (“units”) of code behave as expected. 
Improves confidence in code correctness and supports refactoring.

[Continuous Integration (CI)]{#ci}
: a workflow that automatically tests and validates code whenever changes are made (e.g., when someone pushes to GitHub). 
Reduces integration issues and ensures consistent code quality.

[issue tracking]{#issue-tracking}
: a system for recording, prioritising, and managing bugs, tasks, and feature requests. 
Encourages transparency and project management within teams. 
Example tools: GitHub Issues, Jira. 

[documentation]{#documentation}
: Written guidance that helps others understand, install, and use your code or software. 
Includes README files, inline comments, tutorials, and API references. 
Good documentation is essential for reuse and collaboration.

[code review]{#code-review}
: The practice of having others inspect your code before it’s merged into the main branch. 
Improves code quality, knowledge sharing, and consistency within a team.

[Open Science / Open Research]{#open-science}
: A movement to make research outputs (data, software, papers) accessible, transparent, and reusable by others.
Software engineering practices support this goal by improving reproducibility and sustainability.
